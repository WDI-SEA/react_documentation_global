### Task
In small groups, choose one of the following questions to research in the Facebook React.js documentation.

Create a compelling presentation to present that:
- Answers the question.
- Provides examples via learning materials, diagrams, etc to the audience.
- Bonus: be interactive!

### Overview
- 15 min to research the question.
- 10 min to structure a presentation.
- 5 min to present.
  - **Note:** all group members must participate in the presentation!


### Questions to choose from!
1. What is a controlled component in React? How is this different from regular HTML forms?

2. What is an uncontrolled component in React? Why would we use it instead of a controlled one?

3. What is a synthetic event and how does it compare to regular DOM events?

4. What is a "ref"? List the pros and cons of using it.

5. Describe 1-way and 2-way data binding. Which model does React use? Explain and compare to other popular front-end frameworks.

6. Describe how to best gather information from a form in React. Be prepared to show code!

7. Compare and contrast conditional rendering vs. the`shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method. When would we use one over the other?

8. Compare and contrast stateful, stateless, and functional components in React. List the pros and cons of each. When would we use one over the other?
